 My tech journey began with a computer gifted by my father at 13 years old. During university, I balanced academics and a customer service role to support my family while self-teaching coding and tech skills.

Navigating academia and work instilled resilience and determination in me. I explored cryptocurrency, leading to a role as a Community Manager, and discovered a passion for UI/UX design.

My journey led me to Cloud engineering, where I continue to learn and grow. Despite challenges, my dedication to learning and personal growth remains unwavering.

My tech journey has been transformative, filled with highs and lows. As I look to the future, I'm excited to continue making a difference in the world of technology.
